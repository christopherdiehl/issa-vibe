 A web application built in go that returns a random song from the selected genre

## Inspiration
I really enjoyed music and spend most of my days writing SPA (React) or REST APIs (Express,Go). I really wanted to experiment with a barebones webserver using the (mostly) standard library. 

## Features
- template.yml -> cloudformation template
- buildspec.yml -> codebuild template
- assets -> static content like css, js, html
- nested templates to ensure one layout.html file
- songs stored in genreTrackMap
